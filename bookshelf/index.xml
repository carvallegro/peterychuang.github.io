      <description>The story of how an uneducated couple began a quiet resistance against the Nazi regime is based on the real story of Otto and Elise Hampel, who ran an unsophiscated campaign of dropping postcards containing subversive content around Berlin. While the final fate for the couple is quite obvious right from the start (spoiler alert: it isn&amp;rsquo;t a happy ending), the novel is full of surprises, as it follows Gestapo Inspector Escherich&amp;rsquo;s hunt of the postcards writer as well as other minor characters, who try to survive (or fail to survive) the terrible situation.</description>

      <title>A Man in Love - My Struggle 2</title>

      <description>Somewhere in the middle of the book, Karl Ove Knausgaard spends some twenty or so pages describing the day his wife gave birth to his first daughter, and those pages mostly are about her wife&amp;rsquo;s screaming her head off in pain every half an hour or so.
In this series of books, it does appear that Karl Ove Knausgaard has pulled of something writers and readers alike think is impossible, which is to write something so incredibly boring and not put readers off.</description>

      <title>The Holy Roman Empire : A Thousand Years of Europe&#39;s History</title>

      <description>The Holy Roman Empire is a confusing concept. As Voltaire once put it, the empire was neither &amp;ldquo;holy, nor Roman, nor an empire,&amp;rdquo; and that was indeed true at the time of Voltaire, as the medieval empire had grown into something that, by the early modern period, resembled nothing we understand as a &amp;ldquo;country&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;nation&amp;rdquo; today. While predominantly an empire of German people, as its later name, Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation (albeit not an oft-used name), suggests, it is in fact a collection of people who we would regard today as &amp;ldquo;Germans&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Franks, Bavarians, Saxons, etc&amp;mdash;and those who we wouldn&amp;rsquo;t regard as &amp;ldquo;Germans&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Austrians, Swiss, Dutch, Poles, Bohemians, northern Italians, etc.</description>

      <description>In some ways, this is perhaps the weakest book of the trilogy, in part because the scope has expanded to such an extent to include not just the Trisolarans, but also space species of other origins, the time span of the story stretches to centuries-long, and the speculative aspect of science outside of relativity and quantum mechanics is pushed so far beyond what seems possible, that the story verges on the level of absurdity on par with some episodes of Doctor Who.</description>

      <description>Following the events of The Three-Body Problem and facing the impending arrival of the Trisolaran&amp;rsquo;s invasion fleet in four centuries, humanity has plunged into some kind of chaos. As in all alien invasions in fiction, the extraterrestrial beings have a fatal flaw ready to be exploited by human beings, and it is the job of the four Wallfacers, appointed by the United Nation, to plot against the Trisolarans.
In a story that spans more than two centuries, with the Trisolarans having travelled some two lightyears, battles taking place at the edge of our solar system, and humanity living through anxiety, despair, hope, apathy, and victory (or is it?</description>

      <title>The Three-Body Problem</title>

      <guid>https://novelist.xyz/bookshelf/the-three-body-problem-cixin-liu/</guid>
      <description>A science fiction masterpiece, The Three-Body Problem is an imaginative story dealing with human&amp;rsquo;s communication with and the potential destruction by a hypothetical alien race from our nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, which is a three-star system (hence the name of the book).
With a scope even greater than Star Wars, The Three-Body Problem is a spectacle in itself, but it is also a setup for the next book in the series, The Dark Forest, which takes the scope of the narrative to the next level and asks some serious questions for readers to ponder.</description>

      <description>Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan had won the Second World War, and the United States was partitioned by Germany and Japan. White people were no longer the privileged ones (not in Japan-occupied zone), Jews had all but vanished from New York, and Herbert von Karajan became the Chief Conductor of the New York Philharmonic. In that alternative world, a book about an alternative history where the Allies won the war captured the imagination of the oppressed, while the oppressor sought to murder the person who wrote that book.</description>

      <description>In the run up to the Second World War, Britain took on about ten thousands of Jewish children in a rescue effort now known as Kindertransport. These children came from areas already or soon-to-be occupied by Nazi Germany, and they were brought up in Great Britain by foster parents. Jacques Austerlitz, who arrived in England at an age so young that he couldn&amp;rsquo;t have remembered much about his former life, and whose Welsh foster parents concealed his true identity for long enough to erase any last memory of his prior existence, put off attempting to find his root until he had become an old man.</description>

      <description>Without one single wasted word, Gabriel García Márquez told a story about love in its many guises, from the youthful, passionate love, lust, to the love in old people.</description>

      <title>The Lady of the Camellias</title>

      <description>La Dame aux Camélias is the basis for one of the best known operas in the entire operatic repertoire: Giuseppe Verdi&amp;rsquo;s La Traviata.
Having known the opera and watched the Opéra de Paris&amp;rsquo; production of it at Opéra Bastille, I knew the story roughly before I read the novel, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t expect any surprise, nor did I anticipate being moved by it. After all, most stories in operas are quite quite weak, and the magic of operas are held more by the charm of singers, the spectacles, and the music.</description>

      <description>It would have been a strange situation to find yourself in, that the ideas you&amp;rsquo;d grown up with turned out to be out-of-fashion, and that what you&amp;rsquo;d been working for your whole life turned out to be worthless. It happens every so often to some people, but rarely at the scale of a whole country.
In her latest work, Svetlana Alexievich, the winner of Nobel Prize in 2015, tackles exactly this strange phenomenon during the collapse and the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union.</description>

      <description>Some years ago, I went through a phase of watching every documentary film I could get my hands on. One of the films I stumbled upon was a film about the Chernobyl disaster. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember when I first watched it, and it might not have anything to do with the Fukushima disaster. As with so many of the things I find interesting, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any inherent reason why I found the Chernobyl disaster fascinating.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;In Search of Lost Time&amp;rdquo; is famous for, first of all, its length. With seven volumes (or six, as in this translation), it is among the longest novels ever written. &amp;ldquo;In Search of Lost Time&amp;rdquo; is also famous for its use of very long sentences. Consider the opening sentence of chapter 2 of part 1 of the first volume:
 Combray, from far away, for ten leagues around, seen from the railroad when we arrived there the last week before Easter, was no more than a church summing up the town, representing it, speaking of it and for it into the distance, and, when one approached, holding close around its high dark cloak, in the middle of a field, against the wind, like a shepherdess her sheep, the woolly grey backs of the gathered houses, which a vestige of medieval ramparts girdled here and there with a line as perfectly circular as a small town in a primitive painting.</description>

      <title>The Hobbit &amp; The Lord of the Rings</title>

      <description>Let me begin by confessing that I am no big fan of J. R. R. Tolkien&amp;rsquo;s The Lord of the Rings cycle, and that makes me open to attacks from passionate fans of the cycle.
One of the problems I have with The Lord of the Rings is its similarities with another Ring cycle: Der Ring des Nibelungen by Richard Wagner. One reason for the similarities between two Ring cycles is that both Wagner and Tolkien appeared to have consult the same sources in Norse Mythology&amp;mdash;Völsunga saga and Nibelungenlied&amp;mdash;but it is hard to believe that Tolkien was entirely not influenced by Wagner&amp;rsquo;s Ring, even though he refused to admit it.</description>

      <guid>https://novelist.xyz/bookshelf/war-and-peace-leo-tolstoy/</guid>
      <description>It is difficult to pin down what &amp;ldquo;War and Peace&amp;rdquo; exactly is. In large part, it tells the stories of several Russian aristocratic families&amp;mdash;the Rostovs, Bolkonskys, the Bezhukovs, and others&amp;mdash;with great realism, against the backdrop of the Napoleonic Wars, starting roughly from the time of the Battle of Austerlitz to the defeat of Napoleon by the Russians. Just as his later novel, &amp;ldquo;Anna Karenina, &amp;ldquo;War and Peace&amp;rdquo; embraces everything possible.</description>

      <guid>https://novelist.xyz/bookshelf/anna-karenina-leo-tolstoy/</guid>
      <description>&amp;ldquo;Anna Karenina&amp;rdquo; opens with one of the most iconic sentences in the whole of literature:
 All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.
 The validity of this claim is even more questionable than the opening line of Jane Austen&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Pride and Prejudice&amp;rdquo;:
 It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.</description>
