      <description>As a Linux user, using a recent model of MacBook Pro was nothing but a misadventure, especially given that the laptop I had prior to that was Dell XPS 13 9350, which had a Developer Edition with Linux pre-loaded, which meant it could run Linux without too much trouble. The problems with MacBook Pro were not limited to the difficulties in using Linux or the serious locking-down of macOS, but also the quality control, and their Idiot Genius Bar&amp;rsquo;s treating me like an idiot with a wallet that leaks money.</description>

      <description>As a full-time Linux user, I have never cared much about Apple products. All of my previous computers were PCs that came with Microsoft Windows, which I invariably removed before putting Linux on it. Apple products are overpriced, and installing Linux on MacBooks is, in general, trickier than on an average PC, so I have looked away from MacBooks for years.
Then my Dell XPS 13 died, and I discovered that Dell had terrible service in my part of the world, so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t get it repaired.</description>

      <title>How to make fonts look good on Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/improve-font-rendering-arch-linux-no-infinality/</link>

      <guid>https://novelist.xyz/tech/improve-font-rendering-arch-linux-no-infinality/</guid>
      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it: the plain vanilla font rendering on Linux was horrible. For a long time, I had relied on Infinality patches for freetype2 and fontconfig to improve how texts looked on Arch Linux, and the result was impressive.
But then, the upstream of Infinality died. For some months now, I had been holding onto the patched freetype2 and fontconfig as I was unable to find an acceptable alternative, though it was obvious that I had to make do with the plain vanilla freetype and fontconfig at some point.</description>

      <title>How to install Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/arch-linux-installation-guide/</link>

      <description>Arch Linux is known for, among many other things, such as being at the bleeding edge to a point of unstable (ask anyone trying to get GNOME 3.24 on time), having no graphical installer, thus demanding command line knowledge, which is perhaps intimidating for some. However, Arch Linux allows me to setup a system into my desired state in the shortest amount of time with the least hassles, which is why I keep returning to Arch Linux despite its various annoyances.</description>

      <title>Five Tips For Running Arch Linux As Daily Driver</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/arch-linux-tips/</link>

      <description>Arch Linux has a reputation for being close to bleeding edge, and thus less stable than other distributions. Neither of those points are entirely true, however, as there are other distributions that ship new packages even quicker than Arch, and most updates don&amp;rsquo;t produce catastrophic results. Though because Arch Linux is such that it encourages users to tinker with it, hiccups do occur more frequently in Arch Linux than others, which isn&amp;rsquo;t so much a fault of the distribution itself.</description>

      <title>Ten things you need to do after installing Arch Linux</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/things-to-do-after-installing-arch-linux/</link>

      <description>Arch Linux is famous for its seemingly intimidating installation process that, by default, only gets you to a base system where almost nothing is in it. From that point, you will have the opportunity to build a system that consists only of what you need, such as the display manager and desktop environment of your choosing.
But even after installing and booting into your favourite desktop environment, the road to building daily driver is far from finished.</description>

      <description>Sometime in 2011 or 2012, I began to use Linux exclusively as my primary operating system, and I&amp;rsquo;ve never returned to the Windows-land.
My Linux Machine I use Dell XPS 13 (9350) mainly to write and develop this website, among many other things. For more demanding tasks such as photo-editing, I use a desktop machine with a quad-core processor and hyperthreading.

      <title>How I became a full-time Linux user</title>

      <description>From Windows to Linux: My Linux Journey I think it was 2009 when I tried GNU/Linux for the first time. It was on a ThinkPad, and the distribution (or distro) I tried was Ubuntu. I didnâ€™t know anything about GNU/Linux back then, and I might or might not have been wondering where C:\ was, but I was amazed by the amount of customisations I could do with the operating system.</description>
