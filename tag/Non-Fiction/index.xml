      <description>Somewhere in the middle of the book, Karl Ove Knausgaard spends some twenty or so pages describing the day his wife gave birth to his first daughter, and those pages mostly are about her wife&amp;rsquo;s screaming her head off in pain every half an hour or so.
In this series of books, it does appear that Karl Ove Knausgaard has pulled of something writers and readers alike think is impossible, which is to write something so incredibly boring and not put readers off.</description>

      <description>It would have been a strange situation to find yourself in, that the ideas you&amp;rsquo;d grown up with turned out to be out-of-fashion, and that what you&amp;rsquo;d been working for your whole life turned out to be worthless. It happens every so often to some people, but rarely at the scale of a whole country.
In her latest work, Svetlana Alexievich, the winner of Nobel Prize in 2015, tackles exactly this strange phenomenon during the collapse and the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union.</description>

      <title>Voices from Chernobyl: The Oral History of a Nuclear Disaster</title>

      <description>Some years ago, I went through a phase of watching every documentary film I could get my hands on. One of the films I stumbled upon was a film about the Chernobyl disaster. I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember when I first watched it, and it might not have anything to do with the Fukushima disaster. As with so many of the things I find interesting, there wasn&amp;rsquo;t any inherent reason why I found the Chernobyl disaster fascinating.</description>
