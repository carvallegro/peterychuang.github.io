      <title>Serve static websites with Caddy web server</title>

      <description>First, a little bit of history.
I have been running websites&amp;mdash;personal or otherwise&amp;mdash;on-and-off for long enough to remember Geocities. Although I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t claim to be an expert, I&amp;rsquo;ve seen and done quite a bit over the years, from hand-coding HTML files and uploading files via FTP to running Wordpress on LAMP and LEMP stacks and experimenting with Varnish Cache.
I stopped making websites for a while before building this website with static site generators (first with Jekyll, then with Hugo).</description>

      <title>How to use Bootstrap Navbar without jQuery</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/bootstrap-without-jquery/</link>

      <description>This website uses Bootstrap framework, which is very useful for creating responsive websites. But most of its javascript components aren&amp;rsquo;t use in my case. It also requires jQuery to run, which is 86KB in size before gzipping. For the only two functions I need&amp;mdash;expanding and collapsing the Navbar menu&amp;mdash;depending on jQuery seems unnecessary. And it is indeed unnecessary, because those functions can be achieved by some plain vanilla javascript 1% the size of jQuery.</description>

      <title>How to show related posts in Hugo</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/related-posts-in-hugo/</link>

      <description>The ability to show related posts is not yet a feature in Hugo. At present, one way to achieve this is by showing posts that have common tags or categories with the intersect function, as described in Hugo&amp;rsquo;s documentation.
This, however, will list all the posts with at least one common tag for any given post, which isn&amp;rsquo;t what most people want. For a while, I have been using CSS to hide the list of related posts and only show the first three, a workaround suggested by Justin Dunham, a workaround that I don&amp;rsquo;t particularly like.</description>

      <title>How to load images using the &#34;blur-up&#34; technique</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/progressive-background-image-loading/</link>

      <guid>https://novelist.xyz/tech/progressive-background-image-loading/</guid>
      <description>Loading large images by first showing the blurred versions is becoming quite common, and it is easy to see why. Instead of showing a empty space of solid colour while loading, visitor can see a blurred image before the full image fades in.
In this post, I will describe how it is achieved in this website. The general idea is to create a tiny version of the image, which is small enough to load very quickly, and stretch it to the original size so that it appears blurry.</description>

      <title>Customising categories URLs in Hugo revisited</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/advanced-custom-urls-for-category-pages-in-hugo/</link>

      <guid>https://novelist.xyz/tech/advanced-custom-urls-for-category-pages-in-hugo/</guid>
      <description>A while ago, I wrote a simple workaround for customising URLs of categories pages in Hugo. The purpose was to remove the word &amp;ldquo;categories&amp;rdquo; from the URLs of categories pages, a feature (still) missing in Hugo.
That workaround is simple, and it replicates the behaviour in my old Jekyll site, though it isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect: it can only generate one single page for each category without pagination, while the &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; categories pages supports pagination out of the box.</description>

      <title>How to use Data Files in Hugo: an example</title>

      <description>In this article, I am going to demonstrate how to use Data Files in Hugo site generator.
The Problem As an effort to grow this website, I thought it might be a good idea to have a collection of interesting quotes by great novelists and writers. Even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help traffic, it would still be beneficial for me as a writer.
An easy and obvious way to achieve this is to create a regular page and list all the quotes inside that page.</description>

      <description>This post has been updated to reflect my new deployment process after migrating to Firebase This post has been updated to reflect further important changes
Static site generators are great&amp;mdash;Jekyll is great, and Hugo is even greater&amp;mdash;except when it comes to updating the website. In the old days of my using wordpress, updating a post was a matter of logging in to the Wordpress Admin, making changes to the post, and hitting the &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; button.</description>

      <title>How to customise categories and tags URLs in Hugo</title>

      <description>Update: Here is a new advanced hack for customising categories URLs
Hugo is a great static site generator. Fast page build time and built-in live reload make Hugo a joy to use. But it isn&amp;rsquo;t without its limitation.
One of the limitations I touched upon is the lack of completely customisable taxonomies URLs. By default, categories are located in /categories/something, and tags are located in /tags/something. If you want to change the word &amp;ldquo;categories&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;tags&amp;rdquo; in the URLs into some other words, there is a simple solution, as I explained on Github:</description>

      <title>Hugo vs. Jekyll: a showdown of static site generator</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/hugo-vs-jekyll-static-site-generator/</link>

      <description>Last week, I mentioned that this site is built using Jekyll, a static site generator that, once you get used to it, is much faster to load and more convenient than dynamic content management system such as Wordpress.
(Update: this site now runs on Hugo)
Jekyll is way too slow Jekyll is a good alternative to things like Wordpress, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t without its own problem: the loading speed of the compiled static pages may be very fast because they are static, but those pages take a long time to build.</description>

      <title>How to create a super-fast Jekyll site</title>
      <link>https://novelist.xyz/tech/performant-jekyll-site-with-gulp-cloudflare/</link>

      <description>(Update: this site now runs on Hugo)
Earlier, I wrote a brief note explaining why I use Jekyll, which came down to two major factors: cost and performance. Hosting a Jekyll site on Github is free, eliminating all the costs (save the domain name) associated with running a self-hosted Wordpress site; and Github Pages is very fast.
But there are still some room for improvments. The steps outlined below are what I&amp;rsquo;ve done to optimise my website, partly inspired by David Ensinger&amp;rsquo;s post on the same topic.</description>

      <description>(Update: this site now runs on Hugo)
For a long time, Wordpress was my go-to software to create website. It is free, has a huge community, massive collection of plugins, is not too difficult to set up for basic use, and is capable of running big and complex website. I used Wordpress to run a fairly large and complicated site for quite a while, and it did the job.
But when it came to this particular website, I had one problem.</description>
