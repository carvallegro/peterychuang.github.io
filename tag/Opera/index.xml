      <description>Natalie Dessay, a French soprano, once said that text of many operas are silly. She wasn&amp;rsquo;t the first to say it, and she won&amp;rsquo;t be the last.
Mozart&amp;rsquo;s Die Zauberflöte, the libretto of which was written by Emmanuel Schikaneder, is a great first-time opera: it has tuneful melodies, humours, and relatively easy story. But when you strip away the Masonic theme, Die Zauberflöte is a love story that makes no sense: Tamino falls in love with Pamina because he sees her picture, and Pamina falls in love with Tamino because she hears that Tamino falls in love with her after seeing her picture.</description>
