      <description>Last week, I mentioned that this site is built using Jekyll, a static site generator that, once you get used to it, is much faster to load and more convenient than dynamic content management system such as Wordpress.
(Update: this site now runs on Hugo)
Jekyll is way too slow Jekyll is a good alternative to things like Wordpress, but it isn&amp;rsquo;t without its own problem: the loading speed of the compiled static pages may be very fast because they are static, but those pages take a long time to build.</description>

      <description>(Update: this site now runs on Hugo)
Earlier, I wrote a brief note explaining why I use Jekyll, which came down to two major factors: cost and performance. Hosting a Jekyll site on Github is free, eliminating all the costs (save the domain name) associated with running a self-hosted Wordpress site; and Github Pages is very fast.
But there are still some room for improvments. The steps outlined below are what I&amp;rsquo;ve done to optimise my website, partly inspired by David Ensinger&amp;rsquo;s post on the same topic.</description>

      <description>(Update: this site now runs on Hugo)
For a long time, Wordpress was my go-to software to create website. It is free, has a huge community, massive collection of plugins, is not too difficult to set up for basic use, and is capable of running big and complex website. I used Wordpress to run a fairly large and complicated site for quite a while, and it did the job.
But when it came to this particular website, I had one problem.</description>
